For this experiment, we chose the ECG5000 dataset. Note that the ECG's run from R-peak to R-peak.\r\n![Example_ecg](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/DRAW_1D/blob/master/canvas/ecg5.gif?raw=True)\r\n\r\n  * The __left__ column displays the original signal and the read bar\r\n  * The __middle_ column displays the current Gaussians about to be written\r\n  * The __right__ column displays the written signal plus the write bar\r\n\r\nEvery time-step, the network write to the canvas in the right columns. In this writing operation, we add a mixture of Gaussians to the canvas. Gaussians need only two parameters, which makes them suited for this task. The middle columns plots in _blue_ the five individual Gaussians. The _red_ curve is the summation of the five Gaussians. \r\n\r\nIn the [original post](https://robromijnders.github.io/DRAW/) we discuss some context of the DRAW and refer to additional material. \r\n\r\nAs always, I am curious to any comments and questions.
